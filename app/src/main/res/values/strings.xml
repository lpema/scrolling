    <string name="article">Every time I visit Pokhara I am stunned by its sheer beauty and pristine charm. Pokhara is my homeland where I spent most of my childhood. I graduated from high school in this picturesque place. Whenever I am living away from my hometown, I am nostalgic for its beautiful view, fresh air and friendly faces. Pokhara is a metropolitan city in the Western region of Nepal. It is a valley cradled amongst mountains and hills with meandering rivers. It is a major tourist destination due to its panoramic views. Once you enter the vicinity of this city, you are greeted with magnificent views of the mountains. The Dhaulagiri range and Annapurna range tower majestically over the green valley. For someone who has been living in Kathmandu for years, the greenery of this city always takes me by surprise.
